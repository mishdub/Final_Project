# Polygon Packing Problem

This project focuses on the [Polygon Packing problem](https://cgshop.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/competition/cg-shop-2024/#problem-description) from the CG 2024 competition. By exploring different methods, we aim to provide useful insights and contribute to better solutions for this optimization challenge.

## Problem Description

The input to the problem consists of:

- **A container**: A convex polygon that serves as the bounding region where items must be placed.
- **A set of items**: Each item is also a polygon with a fixed shape, orientation, and an associated integer value.
